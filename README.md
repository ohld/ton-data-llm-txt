# ton-data-llms-txt
`llms.txt` is a great tool to let AI agents understand how to write Dune SQL queries and analyse TON Blockchain data. 

But since this file is stored on Github, I'll use Markdown file extension `llms.md` to keep the syntax highlighted. How knows, that file may become a book someday.

## Usage

Copy-paste the contents of `llms.md` to the prompt of your llm and ask to generate SQL for you. At some point our `llms.md` would be informative enough to generate a valid query (I hope).

## Useful links, that should go to llms.md at some point
